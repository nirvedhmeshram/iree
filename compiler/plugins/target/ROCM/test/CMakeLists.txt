# NOTE: Bazel testing of this backend is impossible because there is no way
# for Bazel to bundle the AMD bitcode files that the backend depends on. Users
# of the compiler can pass explicit flags, but we prefer that default tests
# exercise default flags, which cannot be supported properly on Bazel builds.
